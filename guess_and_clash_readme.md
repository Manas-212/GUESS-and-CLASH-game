Project Title
The Ultimate Guessing Challenge: Number Guess & Rock-Paper-Scissors

Overview of the Project
This project is a multi-level command-line game designed to provide two different classic gaming experiences.

The first level is a Number Guessing Game, where the player must correctly identify a secret number randomly chosen by the computer within a defined range. Upon successfully completing the first level, the player is given the option to advance to the second level.

The second level is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, allowing the player to compete against the computer in a series of rounds until they choose to stop playing. This setup ensures an engaging and progressive gaming experience directly within the console.

Features
Two Levels of Play:

Level 1: Number Guessing: The computer generates a secret number (between 10 and 100), and the player attempts to guess it.

Level 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors: A classic head-to-head game against the computer.

Guess Tracking: The Number Guessing game keeps a running count of the player's attempts.

Input Validation: The game checks if the input is a valid number (in Level 1) and if it's within the specified range. It also validates the choice for Rock-Paper-Scissors.

Interactive Progression: Players can decide whether to proceed to the second game after winning the first.

Replayability: The Rock-Paper-Scissors game allows for multiple rounds until the player chooses to quit.

Technologies/Tools Used
Programming Language: Python 3

Key Python Module: The built-in random module is used to generate the secret number and the computer's choice for Rock-Paper-Scissors.
